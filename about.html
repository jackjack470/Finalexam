          <p>
            Zavian Flowers (TrapLordVegeta) was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the youngest of seven children. 
            Flowers was initially raised in Forest Park on Southside Atlanta's Conley Road. 
            After dropping out of high school during his freshman year, Flowers moved to Cleveland Avenue.
             Like his brother and fellow rapper Lil Keed, who is one year older, Gotit did not start taking 
             rap seriously until his friend Scoot was killed a few days before the release of the group compilation mixtape Young Winning Season in 2016.
             TrapLord then began releasing songs with his brother Lil Keed.
